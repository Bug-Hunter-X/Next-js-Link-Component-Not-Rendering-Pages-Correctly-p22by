# Next.js Link Component Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Next.js `Link` component.  The issue involves pages not rendering correctly, resulting in 404 errors or blank pages despite seemingly correct usage of the `Link` component.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the solution.  This issue is often caused by misconfigurations in the `next.config.js` file or incorrect usage of the `Link` component's `href` prop.
